description: Run frontend and backend tests with comprehensive reporting
---

Run the complete test suite for this application:

1. **Frontend Tests**: Run any frontend tests (if they exist in client/)
2. **Backend Tests**: Run Python tests using pytest (if they exist in server/)
3. **Linting**: Check code quality for both frontend and backend
4. **Type Checking**: Verify TypeScript/JavaScript types (if configured)

Please execute the tests and provide a comprehensive report including:
- Total tests run and results (pass/fail)
- Any errors or warnings found
- Code coverage metrics (if available)
- Linting issues that need to be addressed
- Suggestions for fixing any failures

If tests don't exist yet, offer to create a basic test suite for:
- API endpoint testing (backend)
- Component testing (frontend)
- Integration tests using Playwright

After running tests, suggest next steps for improving test coverage or fixing issues.
